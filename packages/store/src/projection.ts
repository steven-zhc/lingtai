/**
 * The projection runner: how derived tables stay derived.
 *
 * One rule holds all of it. **A projection's writes and its checkpoint advance
 * happen in the same transaction.** Split them and there is no third option — a
 * crash between the two either loses a batch or applies it twice, and which one
 * depends on which write you put first. Together, the checkpoint is simply part
 * of the projection's state, and recovery is "read the checkpoint, carry on".
 *
 * That is why this file talks to Postgres through `pg` rather than through the
 * ORM. Projections are deliberately **not** in the Prisma contract — their shape
 * will change, and changing one is `TRUNCATE` + reset + replay, not a migration
 * (doc/decisions/0003-postgres-event-store.md). A table the contract does not
 * know about has no ORM surface, and a projection needs DDL, `TRUNCATE` and its
 * own upserts regardless. The same deliberate split as the subscriber.
 *
 * Reads still go through the store, and therefore through Prisma: `readAll` is
 * the only cursor, and its payloads are validated and upcast on the way out.
