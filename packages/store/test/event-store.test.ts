/**
 * These tests hit the real database. That is the point.
 *
 * `UNIQUE (stream_id, version)` is the entire concurrency control of this
 * system: if it does not hold, two workers claim the same work item. A mock
 * cannot tell you whether it holds. Neither can one connection — 0009 is the
 * record of a probe that shared a connection between the actor and the observer
 * and therefore confirmed something that was false. So the race test below
 * builds two independent clients and lets them collide.
 *
 * Every stream this file creates is removed afterwards. Cleanup has to disable
 * the append-only rule to do it, which is a global `ALTER TABLE` — do not run
 * this against a database a conductor is writing to.
