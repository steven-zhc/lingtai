/**
 * `task_view` — the one projection.
 *
 * It replaces `board` and `queue`. One row per task Lingtai
 * has touched, holding the latest state and the metadata a card shows, and
 * nothing else: the board's list view is a `select` against this table and no
 * second query ([0012](../../../doc/decisions/0012-one-task-view.md)).
 *
 * ## What is deliberately not here
 *
 * **Gate evidence, review findings, the diff.** All of
 * it is read from the event stream when somebody opens one task. A list view
 * and a detail view have opposite economics — the list is read constantly and
 * needs to be cheap, the detail is read rarely by one person about one task,
 * and folding a few dozen events on the spot is imperceptible. Building a table
 * for the second is paying continuously for an occasional read.
 *
 * The old `board` projection carried all of it, and the card grew heavy for
 * exactly that reason: what is available gets rendered. Moving detail behind a
 * task id makes a card's contents a decision instead of a consequence.
 *
 * ## Two rules that keep a rebuild honest
 *
 * **Every timestamp comes from `event.at`, never from `now()`.** A projection
 * whose rows depend on the clock cannot be rebuilt to the same table twice,
 * which would cost the property that lets a projection's shape change freely at
 * all. That property is load-bearing here, because this table's shape is
 * expected to move.
 *
 * **Retention is the reader's job.** `closed_at` is recorded and every row is
 * kept; `readTasks` filters. The two-day window is a `where` clause, so it is
 * configurable without a rebuild and a rebuild does not depend on when it ran.
 *
 * ## Counting
 *
 * Increments are guarded by `updated_seq <` rather than `<=`, so a replay lands
 * on the same numbers. Gate verdicts are a keyed map rather than a list, for
 * the same reason: assignment is idempotent and appending is not. Only the
 * verdict is kept — the evidence that came with it is detail.
