/**
 * One interface, two implementations — one of which is a stub, on purpose.
 *
 * The contract is the **intersection** of what Claude Code and Codex CLI both
 * have: `SessionStart`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `Stop`.
 * Claude Code's extra three (`SessionEnd`, `PreCompact`, `Notification`) are
 * bonus signal — better when present, never required, and the adapter works
 * without them. Both runtimes are designed for from day one because retrofitting
 * this interface later is a refactor; only `claude-code` is implemented, because
 * writing the second adapter before the first interface has survived real use is
 * guessing at the wrong abstractions.
 *
 * **Containment is Lingtai's responsibility, not the runtime's.** Codex ships
 * a filesystem sandbox and Claude Code does not, and a project's safety level
 * must not depend on which agent happens to be running today. A runtime may
 * *provide* containment; the scheduler matches capabilities before dispatching
 * and records `DispatchRefused` when the combination cannot meet the tier — it
 * never silently downgrades. See doc/decisions/0007-dual-runtime.md.
