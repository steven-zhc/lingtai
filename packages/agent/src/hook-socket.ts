/**
 * The conductor's end of the hook channel.
 *
 * A hook is usually thought of as a guard. It is better understood as **the only
 * channel through which the outside world reports facts to the event log** — and
 * the same round trip carries the verdict back. One socket, both directions.
 *
 * Three rules hold the hot path, and each is a way to make an agent slow or an
 * outage worse:
 *
 * **The verdict is synchronous; persistence is not.** An allowed call is counted
 * in memory and answered immediately. *The event store's availability must never
 * gate an agent's tool call* — a database blip would otherwise stall every tool
 * use in every run. Only a denial persists before answering, and by then the
 * decision is already made, so a slow store delays only a call that was going to
 * be refused.
 *
 * **It answers from memory.** Everything it needs is resolved when the run is
 * registered. No read, no parse, no allocation beyond the reply.
 *
 * **A run it does not know is denied.** The socket is per-conductor, not
 * per-run, and a request carrying an unknown run id is a misconfiguration rather
 * than a permission.
