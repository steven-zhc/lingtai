/**
 * Claiming a work item.
 *
 * This replaces `.runtime/loop.lock.d`, a directory the old loop created to hold
 * a lock and which leaked after every `kill -9` — recovering meant noticing and
 * running `rm -rf` by hand. There is nothing to unwind here, and that is not a
 * tidier implementation of the same idea but a different one:
 *
 *   - **The claim is an append at an expected version.** `UNIQUE (stream_id,
 *     version)` decides the race. The loser gets a `ConcurrencyError`, re-reads,
 *     and finds the item already held. No lock table, no lock file.
 *   - **The absence of a heartbeat is the expiry.** A lease is a timestamp
 *     inside an event. A process that dies holding one leaves an event that
 *     stops being true, which needs no cleanup because nothing was allocated.
 *
 * A crash therefore costs a wait, not an intervention.
