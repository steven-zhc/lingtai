/**
 * Discovery: GitHub becomes an *input source*, not a database.
 *
 * This is the one place in the system that reads a GitHub label — to learn that
 * an item exists, what kind of work it is, and whether something else already
 * owns it. Once a task is claimed the log is the authority and no label is
 * consulted for state again.
 *
 * Since 0012 this appends nothing at all, and since 0022 it stores nothing
 * either: the runnable set is what GitHub currently says, minus what the log
 * says is claimed, computed at the moment somebody needs it. That inversion is
 * the whole of
 * doc/decisions/0001-event-sourcing.md: #35 carried `agent:blocked` and
 * `agent:review` at the same time because `--add-label` is set union, not a
 * transition, and nothing could have noticed.
 *
 * Two exclusions, and the second is a Phase 1 safety rule rather than a
 * preference. `agent-loop.sh` is still working the same repository on an hourly
 * cycle, and the two systems must never both claim a ticket. An issue carrying
 * any `agent:*` label is one the old loop has touched, so Lingtai does not
 * discover it at all.
