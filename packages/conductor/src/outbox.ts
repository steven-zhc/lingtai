/**
 * Side effects that survive a crash.
 *
 * The old loop called `gh` inline. A failed call vanished — no record, no
 * retry, and no way afterwards to tell "we never commented" from "we commented
 * and it did not help". Everything that leaves this machine now goes through
 * here instead.
 *
 * ## The table is the migration's, not this projection's
 *
 * `outbox` is in the contract — it was designed there before any of this was
 * written, with `caused_by` naming the event that produced the row. So `create`
 * and `reset` here do **nothing**: a projection that dropped a schema-managed
 * table would take it out from under `db verify`, and `lingtai projection rebuild
 * outbox` would quietly destroy the migration's work.
 *
 * That turns out to be better rather than a compromise. Because the table is
 * never dropped, delivery state survives a rebuild on its own, and re-applying
 * the log is a no-op against rows that already exist.
 *
 * ## Why it is a projection
 *
 * "A crash between the event and the delivery loses nothing" is only true if
 * the pending row is *derived*. It is: `outbox` is replayed from the log, so a
 * process that dies between appending `WorkItemBlocked` and posting the comment
 * comes back with the row still there.
 *
 * That only works because delivery is **also** in the log. If `delivered_at`
 * lived only in this table, rebuilding it would forget everything already sent
 * and post every comment a second time — which is the exact failure the
 * idempotence criterion is about, arriving through the back door. So the worker
 * appends `OutboxDelivered`, and the projection folds it.
 *
 * ## What is deliverable
 *
 * Two kinds, and both are things a *person* reads on a ticket they are already
 * looking at. Nothing that changes code goes through here — that is git's job,
 * under the merge lane's lock.
 *
 * **Labels are set, never added.** `--add-label` is set union rather than a
 * transition, which is how #35 came to carry `agent:blocked` and `agent:review`
 * at once with nothing able to notice. A state that is computed and then
 * assigned cannot hold two contradictory values.
 *
 * `labelsFor` returns *only* Lingtai's own labels, and the union with
 * whatever else is on the issue is taken in the deliverer (`apps/cli`), which
 * is the only layer that can see GitHub's current state. It has to be there:
 * a projection must be deterministic, and what else is on an issue is not in
 * the log. That was written as an assumption here before anything honoured it,
 * and the first outbox drain duly stripped `enhancement` off three issues.
