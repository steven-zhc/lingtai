/**
 * What the plan promised at a gating point, against what the log shows ran.
 *
 * The other half of the comparison
 * [0015](../../../doc/decisions/0015-five-gates-and-two-extensions.md) promised
 * and [0016](../../../doc/decisions/0016-the-settled-model.md) §4 makes a rule:
 * *a gate that was configured and did not run is Lingtai's bug*. `end-point.ts`
 * computes it for `end`, whose record lives on the work item's stream. This
 * computes it for the four points that produce verdicts, whose record lives on
 * the run's.
 *
 * It exists because the check itself was the thing missing. `merge` was
 * resolved into `GatesResolved`, printed by `lingtai add` and drawn on the
 * board for weeks without ever being built into a pipeline (#58), and `end`
 * had the same shape at the same time (#55). Two of five points were quietly
 * not executing, and nothing anywhere compared the two halves — so the only
 * thing that could have noticed was a person reading a stream by hand.
 *
 * ## The two halves
 *
 * **Planned** is `GatesResolved` on the run: it names all five points and the
 * actions resolved for each, so "the recipe asked for something at `merge`" is
 * a fact in the log rather than in a recipe that may have changed since.
 *
 * **Ran** is any gate event on that same run carrying the point — a request, a
 * verdict, an approval asked for or given, a waiver. Any one of them is proof
 * the pipeline reached the point; none of them is proof it did not.
 *
 * ## Why it is anchored on what landed
 *
 * A run that failed at `prepared` never reaches `proposed`, and that is
 * correct, not a bug — so "planned and no events" on its own would report
 * every ordinary refusal. An item that **landed** is the case with no such
 * excuse: a change on the base branch went past every point on its way there.
 *
 * The last run of the item, because an item that failed once and landed on a
 * second attempt has a first run that legitimately stopped early.
 *
 * `admit` is included, and today nothing runs it. That is the same fact this
 * check exists to surface rather than an exception to it: a recipe that names
 * actions there is being told they had no effect on what merged.
