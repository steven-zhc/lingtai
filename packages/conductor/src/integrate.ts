/**
 * The integrator: merge base in, verify, merge out.
 *
 * This is the file that exists because of a specific, expensive silence. The old
 * loop's `integrate()` had six `return 1` paths and not one of them emitted a
 * log line, a comment or a label. #58 and #59 re-ran five times for roughly $29
 * while the actual cause — uncommitted work in the operator's own checkout of
 * `main` — was never reported by anything at all.
 *
 * So there is one rule here, and the code is shaped around it rather than merely
 * observing it: **no path returns without an event.** Every exit goes through
 * `refuse()` or `succeed()`, both of which append before they return, and the
 * only way to leave this function is through one of them. A reason is a typed
 * value from the catalogue, not a string someone wrote at the time.
 *
 * Two structural changes make most of those failures impossible rather than
 * merely reported:
 *
 * **The integrator owns its worktree.** It is cut from the same bare mirror the
 * agent's came from, and the operator's checkout is never read, written or
 * looked at. A dirty working copy somewhere else cannot affect a merge that does
 * not touch it.
 *
 * **The lane is a session-level advisory lock**, not a file. Two integrations
 * against one base serialise in Postgres, and a process that dies holding the
 * lock drops it when its connection closes — there is nothing to unwind.
