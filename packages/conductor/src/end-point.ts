/**
 * The `end` point, resolved against the outcome a work item actually reached.
 *
 * `end` is the one point that cannot refuse: its actions run for effect. They
 * are declared in a recipe and carried out afterwards, by whoever holds a
 * GitHub client — so the plan has to cross into the log first, which is what
 * `EndActionsResolved` is for. Resolving is a fact and belongs in the same
 * transaction as the outcome; doing is I/O and must not be able to undo it.
 *
 * ## Why this is its own file
 *
 * It used to be a private function in `run-once.ts`, with one call site: the
 * line where that same run merged the branch. Everything that landed by any
 * other route — `lingtai approve`, the board's approve button — integrated,
 * appended `WorkItemLanded`, and stopped. The point was configured, the log
 * said so in `GatesResolved`, and it silently did not run. That is exactly the
 * half of the responsibility [ADR 0016](../../../doc/decisions/0016-the-settled-model.md)
 * §4 calls Lingtai's bug, and it went unnoticed for as long as it did because
 * every item that had ever landed had landed inline.
 *
 * A point that fires on *any* terminal outcome cannot live on one of the paths
 * that reaches one. It lives here, and every path calls it.
 *
 * ## An empty resolution is still a resolution
 *
 * When a recipe declares `end` actions and none of them match the outcome, this
 * appends the event anyway, with an empty list. That reverses the original
 * decision — "an empty list would be a row saying no effects, which is the same
 * as no row and costs a write" — and the reason is the distinction the whole
 * model rests on: *nothing was configured* and *something was configured and
 * did not run* must not look the same from the log. With no row, an item that
 * landed under a recipe whose only `end` action was `when: blocked` is
 * indistinguishable from one whose `end` point was never reached, and the
 * comparison [ADR 0015](../../../doc/decisions/0015-five-gates-and-two-extensions.md)
 * promised — `GatesResolved` says `end` had actions, the item landed, nothing
 * resolved — cannot be computed without guessing.
 *
 * A project that configures no `end` at all still writes nothing. There the
 * skip is the user's decision, and `GatesResolved` already records it.
