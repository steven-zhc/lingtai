/**
 * One work item, discovery through merge, with a person watching.
 *
 * This is the wiring, and almost none of the logic — every piece it calls has
 * its own tests and its own reasons. What is here is the *order*, and the order
 * is the part that has to be right:
 *
 *   resolve the recipe from origin/<base>   never from the agent's branch
 *   resolve the environment                 a declared name with no value
 *                                           refuses here, before the money
 *   discover, claim                         the constraint decides the race
 *   provision the worktree                  filtered env, submodules, 0600
 *   prove the hook fails closed             before anything is dispatched
 *   RunStarted                              the conductor knows more than the hook
 *   run the agent                           on the socket, restricted by nothing
 *   the diff → `proposed` → `merge`         each refusal typed and recorded
 *   → integrate                             a point with actions always runs
 *
 * **Every exit appends.** A run that ends leaves either `RunFinished` or
 * `RunFailed`, and a work item that does not land is either released or blocked
 * with a question. The old loop could end in silence in at least seven places;
 * that is the thing being replaced, so `finally` blocks here are not tidiness.
