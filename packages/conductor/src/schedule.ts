/**
 * Taking the queue, rather than one issue somebody named.
 *
 * This is the difference between "it worked" and "it works", and it is what
 * Phase 2's exit criterion means by **consecutive**: the second item was picked
 * up by the conductor, not by a person typing another number. One run proves
 * the pipeline. Two in a row prove there is nothing in it that only works once
 * — a lock not released, a worktree not removed, a checkpoint not advanced.
 *
 * The loop is small on purpose. design.md §8 refuses a general workflow engine,
 * and this is a `while` over a projection: discover, take the top runnable
 * item, run it, repeat.
 *
 * ## The trap
 *
 * `runOnce` **releases** a work item when a run fails, and a released item goes
 * straight back into the queue — that is what `WorkItemReleased` is for, and it
 * is right, because a run that died should not leave the ticket claimed
 * forever.
 *
 * The consequence is that the obvious loop is an infinite one. Take the top
 * item, fail, release, take the same top item, fail, release — spending an
 * agent's worth of money every pass, forever, on the same broken ticket. The
 * old loop had a version of this: it re-ran #58 and #59 five times for roughly
 * $29 because nothing remembered that the previous attempt had just failed.
 *
 * So a pass remembers what it has attempted and will not attempt it twice.
 * Deliberately in memory and not in the log: "this scheduler has already tried
 * this today" is a fact about *this pass*, not about the work item, and writing
 * it to an append-only log would make a restart inherit a grudge. A new pass
 * starts fresh, which is what you want after a fix.
