/**
 * Granting the approval a held run is waiting for, and merging what was
 * actually looked at.
 *
 * `--no-merge` on its own is half a feature. The obvious way to finish a held
 * run — run it again without the flag — starts a *new* run: a new worktree, the
 * agent again, and a different diff. The thing that merges is then not the thing
 * anyone approved, which defeats the entire point of stopping to look.
 *
 * So this takes the held run's own `headSha` and merges that. `onSha` does the
 * work it was designed for: the approval was recorded against a commit, and if
 * the branch has moved since, this refuses rather than merging something nobody
 * agreed to.
 *
 * This is a stopgap with a known shape. It is the CLI half of #21 — approve and
 * reject on the board — and when that lands the two must become one path rather
 * than two vocabularies for one idea. What is here is what makes `--no-merge`
 * mean something before then.
