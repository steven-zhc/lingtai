/**
 * `task_view`, against the real store.
 *
 * It spans all three aggregates — the task's own stream, the run's, and the
 * integration lane's — so the seed writes to all of them and the cases assert
 * what a card ends up saying.
 *
 * Two properties matter more than the rest:
 *
 * **Rebuilding changes nothing.** This is what makes the table's shape free to
 * change, and it is why every timestamp here comes from the event rather than
 * from `now()`.
 *
 * **Retention is a query.** A landed task falling out of the window must still
 * be a row. Deleting it would make the projection depend on when it last ran.
