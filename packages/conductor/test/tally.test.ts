/**
 * The exit tally, against the real store.
 *
 * The case that matters is the first one: a run this process held, and that
 * somebody approved and the integrate lane merged while the same pass carried
 * on. `runOnce` returned `held` and it was true when it was returned; by the
 * time the summary printed it was not. Counting what the process did printed
 * `0 landed` over a merge and exited 1 on the count.
