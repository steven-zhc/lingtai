/**
 * The comparison itself: the plan in the log against the verdicts in the log.

 * Written from events rather than from a run, because that is exactly what the
 * check reads. A run takes two minutes and proves the conductor's wiring; this
 * proves the *reading* — which is the half that was missing when `merge` and
 * `end` both quietly stopped executing (#58, #55) and nothing noticed for a day.
 *
 * The interesting case is the negative one: an item that landed, whose run
 * planned a person at `merge`, and whose stream holds no gate event for that
 * point. That is the shape of the two changes that merged into `main` with
 * nobody's approval.
