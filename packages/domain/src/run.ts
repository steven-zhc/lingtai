/**
 * The Run aggregate: `run-{ulid}`, alive for hours, noisy.
 *
 * This is where the old loop's telemetry went to die. Guard blocks went to
 * stderr inside a log nobody parsed — 132 of them across 56 of 73 runs, 77% of
 * runs tripping the guard, and not one of them ever seen. Cost records went to a
 * `.jsonl` that also contained raw `pnpm build` output, so 9,555 of its 42,147
 * lines were not JSON and the file would not parse. Every number this reducer
 * exposes is a number that existed before and could not be read.
 *
 * The load-bearing subtlety is `onSha`. A gate verdict is about **a diff**, not
 * about a ticket. In the old system approval was a label, and a label survives
 * any amount of rewriting — so a force-push inherited its own approval. Here a
 * verdict records the sha it was made against, and `gatesOn(state)` returns only
 * the verdicts that match the current head. Nothing has to remember to
 * invalidate anything; a new head simply has no verdicts yet.
