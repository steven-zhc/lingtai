/**
 * The Project aggregate: `prj-{project}`, alive as long as the project is

 *
 * It holds what is Lingtai's rather than the repository's: where to reach the
 * repository — owner and base branch — and the last **resolved configuration**,
 * which is the hash the recipe came out as and the commit it came from.
 *
 * The recipe itself is not here. It lives in the managed repository and is
 * re-read from `origin/<base>` for every run, because a snapshot of it would be
 * a second source of truth (doc/decisions/0005-config-in-target-repo.md). The
 * hash is kept instead: it says *whether the configuration changed* between two
 * runs, which is what a reader of the log needs, without pretending to be the
 * configuration.
