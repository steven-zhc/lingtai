/**
 * The WorkItem aggregate: `wi-{project}-{n}`, alive for weeks.
 *
 * The failure this replaces is specific. In the old loop a ticket's state was
 * the set of `agent:*` labels on its GitHub issue, and `--add-label` is set
 * union, not a transition — nothing forbade a contradictory pair and nothing
 * reconciled one. #35 carried `agent:blocked` **and** `agent:review` at the same
 * time, and no code was wrong; the model was.
 *
 * So `lifecycle` here is a discriminated union rather than a bag of flags. There
 * is no value of `WorkItemState` in which an item is both claimed and blocked,
 * because there is no way to write one down. The facts that outlive a
 * transition — title, labels, links — sit outside the union, where they belong.
 *
 * One thing this reducer deliberately cannot see: gates, approvals and merges.
 * Those are events on the Run and Integration streams, because a run emits
 * hundreds of events while a work item lives for weeks and one stream would make
 * every read expensive (design.md §4). The lifecycle drawn in design.md §4 spans
 * all three aggregates; assembling it is the board projection's job, not this
 * function's.
