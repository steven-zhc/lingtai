/**
 * The gate: one primitive, four kinds.
 *
 * Verification, code review and human approval look like three features. They
 * are one — **a named check that produces a verdict about a specific diff** —
 * and collapsing them is what makes "configure it for another project" a YAML
 * file rather than a patch. Adding a CI check, a second reviewer or a security
 * scan is a configuration line.
 *
 * **`onSha` is load-bearing.** A verdict is about a diff, not about a ticket.
 * Bind it to the commit and a force-push invalidates the approval by
 * arithmetic — `gatesOn()` in `@lingtai/domain` simply stops returning it. In
 * the old system approval was a label, and a label survives any amount of
 * rewriting.
 *
 * Four kinds of action produce a verdict — `run`, `agent`, `watch`, `human` —
 * and all four are implemented. `run` and `human` need nothing from the caller;
 * `agent` needs a reviewer and `watch` needs the diff's file list, and
 * `run-once` supplies both. A kind whose dependency is missing is refused by
 * name rather than skipped — see `from-recipe.ts`. The pipeline, the events and
 * `onSha` are the same for all four.
 *
 * `close` and `labels` are the other two kinds. They are effects rather than
 * verdicts, they only run at `end`, and they never reach this interface.

 * `needs-approval` is a third outcome, not a flavour of failure.

 * the same way: nothing is wrong, and nothing may proceed until a person says
 * so. Folding that into `failed` would put "the build is broken" on a card
 * whose build is fine, and folding it into `passed` would merge it.
