/**
 * Running one command in a worktree, and coming back with something a person
 * can act on.
 *
 * This was inside `process-gate.ts`, and it is out here because the prepare
 * stage needs exactly the same execution and none of the same meaning. A gate's
 * result is a **verdict about a commit**, bound to `onSha` and invalidated by a
 * force-push. A prepare step runs before the agent has written anything and
 * holds no verdict about anything. Sharing the runner is right; sharing the
 * result type would have quietly given prepare an `onSha` that means nothing.
 *
 * It lives in `@lingtai/actions` rather than in a package of its own because
 * the dependency already runs that way — the conductor imports the gates — and a
 * package with one file in it is a worse answer than a slightly wide name.
 *
 * The three things this does that a bare `spawn` does not:
 *
 * **A failure carries its log tail.** The board's promise is that a card is
 * workable without leaving it, and "it failed" with no output is a link to
 * somewhere else wearing a disguise.
 *
 * **A timeout is a distinct outcome.** A command that ran out of time and one
 * that ran and refused are different problems with different fixes, and the
 * caller should not have to guess which it got.
 *
 * **The buffer is bounded, not just the evidence.** A runaway process can print
 * faster than anything reads it.
