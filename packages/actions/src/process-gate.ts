/**
 * The process gate: run a command, the exit code is the verdict.
 *
 * This is `verify.sh` unchanged, which is the point — the old loop's build check
 * was the one part of it that worked, and collapsing it into the same primitive
 * as review and approval is what makes the other three cost a configuration line
 * (design.md §2).
 *
 * The execution itself now lives in `command.ts`, because the prepare stage
 * needs the same spawning, the same bounded buffer and the same distinction
 * between a timeout and a refusal — while needing none of this file's meaning.
 * What is left here is exactly the translation from "a command ended" to "a
 * verdict about a commit", which is the part that is genuinely about gates.
