/**
 * The agent gate: a second agent, cold.
 *
 * This is the gate experiment 001 was run to justify, and it earned its place.
 * Issue #58 in `nextloom-ai-admin` passed agent self-review, `verify.sh`, CI, a
 * full human read, and merged — and hours later the same agent filed three bugs
 * against its own merged code. A reviewer given only the issue and the diff
 * found all four known defects in a single finding, plus two nobody had found,
 * both still on `develop` and neither covered by any of ~300 issues.
 *
 * The claim being tested was that self-review after ~89 turns of committed
 * reasoning is not a second opinion. It is not.
 *
 * **Cold is the whole mechanism, and it is fragile.** The reviewer gets the
 * issue text, the diff and the worktree. It does not get the implementer's
 * plan, transcript, or session — and note that `sessionIdFor` is a *function of
 * the run id*, so handing this the run's own id would resume the implementer's
 * session and quietly destroy the only property that matters. It runs under its
 * own id for exactly that reason.
 *
 * Three things are fixed here rather than left to the recipe, because
 * experiment 001 measured each of them going wrong:
 *
 * **The severity rubric.** The reviewer rated silent data corruption — with two
 * actions returning success and an audit row that lies — as `major`. That is a
 * blocker. Left to judgement it will be under-rated again.
 *
 * **A finding needs a failure scenario.** An observation without one is an
 * opinion, and opinions are what made the old review queue unworkable.
 *
 * **Concurrency and check-then-write are named.** All four known defects were
 * that one shape. The experiment is explicit that this tests *the gate as
 * designed* rather than a generic reviewer, so the checklist is part of the
 * gate, not part of the configuration.
 *
 * A recipe's `prompt` is appended, never substituted. It can add what this
 * project cares about; it cannot remove the rubric — the same rule the recipe
 * follows everywhere else.
 *
 * **Adversarial verification is deliberately not here.** It was designed to
 * filter false positives, and the measured false-positive rate is zero: all
 * three findings in 001 were real. A filter with nothing to filter still costs
 * an agent call. Add it when false positives actually appear.

const RUBRIC = `
Severity is not a judgement call. Use this rubric exactly.

- blocker — data is silently wrong, or lost, or a caller is told something
  succeeded when it did not. Silent corruption is a blocker even when it is
  rare, and *especially* when the system reports success and writes an audit
  record that disagrees with what happened. A race that can corrupt data is a
  blocker, not a major.
- major — a defect a user will hit in normal use, that is visible when it
  happens.
- minor — a real defect that is cosmetic, or so narrow it needs contrivance.

If you are between two levels, take the higher one.`;

const CHECKLIST = `
Look at these first. They are where the defects have actually been.

1. **Concurrency and check-then-write.** A SELECT that decides something and an
   UPDATE that acts on it, with nothing constraining the row in between. Ask
   whether the thing that was read is asserted in the write. Ask what a second
   writer does between the two. Ask whether the table is written by anything
   else.
2. **Failure paths that report success.** Two statements where the second can
   fail after the first has committed. What is the caller told? What does the
   audit trail say?
3. **Error states rendered as empty states.** A load that fails, sets null, and
   renders the same branch as "there is nothing here". What is the operator
   told, and what do they do next?
4. **Tests that assert less than they appear to.** A test whose name claims a
   behaviour and whose assertions would pass with that behaviour broken.`;

const CONTRACT = `
Report as a single JSON object, and nothing else after it:

{"findings":[{"file":"src/x.ts","line":42,"severity":"blocker",
  "claim":"one sentence, what is wrong",
  "failureScenario":"concrete inputs or interleaving, then the wrong outcome"}]}

Rules:
- **No failure scenario, no finding.** If you cannot write the concrete sequence
  that produces a wrong outcome, you do not have a finding, you have an opinion.
  Leave it out.
- \`line\` may be null if the defect is the absence of something.
- Report findings only. Do not propose the fix — a remedy that differs from the
  one eventually taken is not a miss, and prescribing costs you attention you
  should spend finding.
- An empty list is a real answer. Say {"findings":[]}.

Do not read other issues, run \`gh\`, or look at anything outside this worktree
and the diff above. Your value is that you do not know what anyone concluded.`;
