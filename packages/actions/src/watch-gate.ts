/**
 * The `watch` action: look at what the diff touches, and stop when it touches
 * something a person should see.
 *
 * The cheapest gate there is — it reads a list of paths and matches globs, with
 * no process and no model — and two of the three things it guards were real
 * gaps in the old loop.
 *
 * **`tamper`.** `package.json` scripts and the test configuration decide what
 * the build gate actually verifies, and the agent can edit them. A change that
 * edited the verification and then passed the verification was indistinguishable
 * from one that passed. The old loop had no defence here at all.
 *
 * **The migration hold.** A schema change is applied by a person who has looked
 * at it, not by a merge. The integrator refuses these too; this one runs
 * earlier, puts the reason on the card, and names the files.
 *
 * `then` decides which of the two things a match means. `request-approval` is
 * "someone look at this" — the diff is fine, it just is not the machine's to
 * wave through. `fail` is "this should not have happened", for a watch on
 * something nothing legitimate touches.
 *
 * The evidence names the files **and what to do about them**, because a card
 * that says "held: tamper" sends the reader somewhere else to find out why, and
 * that is the failure the board exists to remove.
