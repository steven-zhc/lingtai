/**
 * What makes the conductor run without anyone asking it to.
 *
 * A completion event — landed, released, blocked, refused — means a task just
 * stopped occupying the conductor, so there may be something else to pick up.
 * Postgres already notifies on append, so this is a subscription and not a
 * timer, the same as everything else in the system.
 *
 * ## Three holes, and they are the whole of this file
 *
 * **Cold start.** With nothing in flight there is no completion event, so an
 * event-driven loop never begins. It runs once at startup.
 *
 * **A new issue appends nothing.** The queue comes from GitHub now (0012), so
 * somebody opening an issue produces no event and nothing here hears about it.
 *
 * This is the one place a timer is right, and it is worth being precise about
 * why. Everywhere else a timer would be substituting for a signal that exists —
 * Postgres notifies on append, so polling the log would be choosing to be slow.
 * There is no such signal for "somebody opened an issue on GitHub". A webhook
 * can supply one, and #28 does, but a webhook needs a public address and this
 * runs on a laptop: it is an optimisation, and an optimisation must not be the
 * only path. So the loop also sweeps on a long interval, and the interval is
 * long because the sweep is a fallback and not the mechanism.
 *
 * **The failure loop.** A failed run *releases* its task, a release is a
 * completion event, and a completion event triggers the next pass — where the
 * top of the queue is the ticket that just failed. That is an infinite loop at
 * agent prices, and it is not hypothetical: the old harness re-ran two tickets
 * five times for roughly $29 because nothing remembered the last attempt. The
 * guard is `last_attempt_at` on `task_view`, applied by `selectRunnable`, and it
 * lives in the table rather than in memory precisely so that a daemon crashing
 * on a bad ticket does not come back and spend the money again.
 *
 * ## One pass at a time
 *
 * A pass takes minutes and events arrive during it. Running a second one
 * concurrently would race for the same claim, so an event during a pass sets a
 * flag and the loop goes round again when it finishes — which also collapses a
 * burst of events into one extra pass rather than one each.
