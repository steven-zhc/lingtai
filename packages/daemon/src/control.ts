/**
 * Telling the conductor what to do, and knowing whether it is listening.
 *
 * Two mechanisms, deliberately different, because they are answering different
 * kinds of question ([0013](../../../doc/decisions/0013-daemon-hosts-the-work.md)):
 *
 * **Control goes through the log.** Pausing is a decision somebody made, and
 * `ApprovalGranted` is already that shape — "who stopped the conductor at four
 * o'clock" should not need a different mechanism than "who approved this
 * merge". It also means a command issued while the daemon is down is waiting
 * when it comes back, which is the behaviour you want rather than a race.
 *
 * **Liveness does not.** A heartbeat every few seconds, forever, fails the
 * log's admission test — *is this worth remembering later* — and would bury
 * everything that passes it. `daemon_status` is one mutable row, and it is the
 * only mutable operational state in the system.
 *
 * ## What "pause" means, precisely
 *
 * It stops the conductor **taking new work**. A run already in flight keeps
 * going. 0013 promised three verbs — drain, pause, stop — and two of them
 * turned out to be the same thing: a pass takes one item, so "finish what you
 * have and take nothing new" and "take nothing new" are one behaviour. The
 * third, killing a running agent, needs a capability the runtime does not
 * expose; until it does, a run you want gone ends when its lease expires and
 * the claim returns. Saying so is better than shipping a Stop button that
 * quietly means Pause.
