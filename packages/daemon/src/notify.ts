/**
 * Telling the operator when the operator is the bottleneck.
 *
 * ## Why nothing here is retried
 *
 * A retry is right for a fact somebody will read later and wrong for an
 * interruption: a notification delivered an hour late, about a decision already
 * made, is worse than none — it trains you to ignore the next one. So this is
 * fire-and-forget, and a failure is logged rather than queued. Nothing else in
 * the system retries either since 0022, but for a different reason: GitHub is
 * converged rather than retried, and this cannot be converged because there is
 * no state to compare against.
 *
 * The criterion "notification failure never blocks the event" is met by the
 * shape rather than by a queue: this reads the log and never writes to it, so
 * there is no path by which it can hold anything up.
 *
 * ## The channel is an interface because it will be replaced
 *
 * macOS notifications are what one person on one laptop needs. The thing that
 * should not have to change when that stops being true is *which events are
 * worth interrupting somebody for* — so the subscription model knows nothing
 * about how a message is delivered.
 *
 * ## Click-through is conditional, and says so
 *
 * `terminal-notifier` can open a URL when the notification is clicked;
 * `osascript` cannot. Both are used when available, in that order, and
 * `clickable` reports which one you got — a notification that silently is not
 * clickable would be a small lie repeated every time.
