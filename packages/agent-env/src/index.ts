 * The variables a process needs in order to be a process at all — **layer 1**.

 * the things a shell needs to find a binary. Those are two different questions
 * and conflating them is how the first real run against a repository died on
 * `/bin/sh: pnpm: command not found`.
 *
 * That failure had three instances and one cause: the agent was given `PATH` and
 * `HOME`, the gates were given `PATH` and not `HOME` — which `pnpm` needs for
 * its store and its config — and the prepare stage was given neither. Three call
 * sites, three different answers, one of them right. So it is computed here,
 * once.
 *
 * Deliberately short. `NODE_OPTIONS` is excluded because it injects behaviour
 * into every child; anything a project genuinely needs belongs in `env.required`,
 * where a person wrote it down.
 *
 * `HOME` is the operator's, which is what makes a warm package store possible
 * and every install after the first one fast. It also means a command can read
 * the operator's home directory — contained by the tier, not by this, and worth
 * revisiting if a scratch home ever becomes affordable.
 *
 * **`USER` is here because Claude Code cannot log in without it.** The first
 * real run against `nextloom-ai-admin` reached the agent and died on
 * "Not logged in · Please run /login", with `HOME` set and the credentials
 * exactly where they always are. Measured directly: with `USER`, the run calls
 * the API and costs money; with `SHELL` instead and no `USER`, it reports zero
 * tokens and zero cost and never calls anything. macOS finds a keychain item by
 * who is asking, and with nobody asking there is nothing to find.
 *
 * `LOGNAME` is its POSIX twin and some tools read that one instead. `SHELL` is
 * deliberately *not* here: it was not needed, and leaving it out keeps the
 * shell a command runs under predictable rather than inherited.
