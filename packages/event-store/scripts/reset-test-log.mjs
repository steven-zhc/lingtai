/**
 * Empty the test database's log.
 *
 *   LINGTAI_TEST=1 pnpm --filter @lingtai/event-store db:reset-test
 *
 * The suite appends real events and cleans up its own streams, but the log as a
 * whole only grows: 945 events and a sequence past 11,000 after a few weeks of
 * runs. Most tests do not care. `rebuilding changes nothing on screen` does,
 * because a rebuild replays the *whole* log — so that test's cost is the log's
 * length, and it got slower with every suite run anyone had ever done until it
 * crossed the 60s timeout and started failing for a reason that had nothing to
 * do with the code being tested.
 *
 * Deliberately a separate command rather than a hook in `beforeAll`. Wiping a
 * database is not something a test run should do on its own initiative, and a
 * suite that silently truncates is one nobody can point at a database they care
 * about — which is exactly the mistake this is cleaning up after.
 *
 * ## Why this cannot hit the real log
 *
 * Two independent checks, because one is a typo away from nothing. The test
 * flag must be set, *and* the resolved connection string must differ from the
 * one resolved without it. If someone points TEST_DATABASE_URL at their own
 * database, the second check is what refuses.
