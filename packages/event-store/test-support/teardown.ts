/**
 * What the suite leaves behind, removed.
 *
 * Every database-touching test invents a throwaway project called
 * `esctest<random>` and appends **real** events for it — that is deliberate,
 * these tests are not mocked. What was missing is the other half: nothing ever
 * removed them, so the test log gained a project per run for ever.
 *
 * That is not merely untidy, and the way it failed is worth writing down. An
 * `esctest*` project's outbox rows named GitHub issues that never existed, so
 * delivery answered 404, `attempts` climbed, and past `MAX_ATTEMPTS` the row
 * was dead for good. (The outbox itself is gone — 0022 — but the lesson is not:
 * residue from one suite is what fails the next one.) Twelve such rows
 * accumulated, and then
 * `lingtai doctor`'s own test — which asserts the whole database is green —
 * started failing on residue no test in that file had created. A suite that
 * fails because of what an *earlier* suite left is a suite nobody trusts.
 *
 * Deleting from `events` is the thing this system says it should never make
 * routine. That rule is about the operator's log; this is not that log, and the
 * guard below is what keeps the distinction real rather than assumed — it
 * refuses to delete anything if the log holds a stream for a project that is
 * not throwaway.
 *
 * Set `LINGTAI_KEEP_TEST_DATA=1` to skip this and inspect what a run produced.
 *
 * Three things here fail *silently* if you get them wrong, and all three did
 * once, in this order:
 *
 * - It is wired as vitest's **`globalSetup`**, whose module may export a
 *   `teardown`. There is no `globalTeardown` option — that is Jest's name, and
 *   vitest drops the unknown key without a word.
 * - This module runs *outside* the test files, so nothing has loaded
 *   `.env.local` yet. Importing `@lingtai/env` for its side effect is what makes
 *   `LINGTAI_TEST_DATABASE_URL` exist here at all; without it the URL is `undefined`,
 *   the function returns at its first line, and every run looks like a run that
 *   cleaned up.
 * - `delete from events` does nothing unless `lingtai_events_no_delete` is
 *   disabled first. The rule answers `DO INSTEAD NOTHING`, so the statement
 *   succeeds and removes no rows. The rule is re-enabled in a `finally`: a live
 *   database left without its append-only guarantee is far worse than a test
 *   database left dirty.
