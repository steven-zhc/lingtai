/**
 * The subscriber, against the real database.
 *
 * The assertion that carries the weight is the third one: kill the listener's
 * backend mid-stream, append while it is down, and require that what it
 * eventually delivers has no gap and no duplicate. Everything else here is a
 * precondition for that being meaningful.
 *
 * Every test appends from the **pooled** connection and listens on the
 * **direct** one — two connections, which is the only shape that proves
 * anything (doc/decisions/0009-two-connections.md).
