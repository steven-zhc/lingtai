 * append at an expected version either lands or violates the constraint, and
 * the loser re-reads and retries. The old loop used a `.runtime/loop.lock.d`
 * directory that leaked after every hard kill and needed a manual `rm -rf`; see
 * doc/decisions/0003-postgres-event-store.md.
 *
 * So the interesting behaviour here is not the happy path. It is that a losing
 * writer gets a `ConcurrencyError` and not a Prisma error, and that a batch is
