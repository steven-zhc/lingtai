/**
 * The subscriber: what makes this system event-driven rather than timed.
 *
 * With it, `interval` never has to exist as a configuration value — the
 * conductor and the board wake on an append instead of on a clock. It is also
 * the single reason the store is PostgreSQL and not SQLite
 * (doc/decisions/0003-postgres-event-store.md).
 *
 * Three rules, and each of them is the difference between "works in a demo" and
 * "does not lose events".
 *
 * **`LISTEN` before the catch-up read, never after.** Registering the listener
 * first means an append that happens *during* catch-up is announced rather than
 * dropped into the window between "read the log" and "start listening".
 *
 * **The notification is a nudge, not the payload.** `NOTIFY` carries the `seq`
 * only — the payload caps at 8000 bytes and an event body can exceed it — so a
 * nudge triggers a drain of everything after `lastSeq`, not a fetch of the one
 * row named. That is also what makes a coalesced or duplicated notification
 * harmless: `lastSeq` only ever moves forward, and only after a handler returns.
 *
 * **The connection is `DIRECT_DATABASE_URL`.** Through a transaction pooler the
 * listener's backend is handed to someone else between statements and the
 * registration goes with it. Nothing errors; the notification simply never
 * comes. See doc/decisions/0009-two-connections.md — that is the failure this
 * whole file is shaped around.
