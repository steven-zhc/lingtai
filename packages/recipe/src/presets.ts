/**
 * Presets: the defaults a recipe can `extends` instead of restating.
 *
 * A preset carries the shape a *toolchain* implies — how you install, how you
 * verify — not what a *project* decides. Which gates are mandatory, where the
 * env file is planted and which kinds of work item are eligible all differ
 * between two repositories using the same package manager, so none of them has
 * a defensible default and none is here.
 *
 * Deliberately small. There is one preset because there is one project; a second
 * that is guessed at rather than derived from a repository that exists would be
 * exactly the configuration sprawl design.md §8 refuses.

   * a repository has to be read off that repository.
   *
   * The install runs at the `prepared` point, not at `proposed`. It was at the
   * later point briefly, which fixed the gate and left the agent holding an empty
   * worktree — unable to run the tests it was being asked to keep green.
   *
   * `submodules: true` is not a stylistic default either. `git worktree add`
   * does not populate submodules, and a worktree without them fails every test
   * that imports one — which reads the same wrong way.
