/**
 * `tamper` — the surface an agent can edit to change what its own gates check.
 *
 * `package.json` scripts and the test configuration decide what the build gate
 * actually verifies, and the agent can edit both. The old loop had no defence
 * here at all: a change that edited `verify.sh` and then passed `verify.sh` was
 * indistinguishable from one that passed.
 *
 * `.lingtai/**` is here for completeness rather than for safety. The recipe
 * that governs a run is read from `origin/<base>`, so editing it on a branch
 * changes nothing about the run in flight — but it changes the *next* one, and
 * a person should see that before it merges.
 *
 * Note what this is not: a security boundary. An agent that wants to weaken its
 * own verification can do so in a file nobody thought to watch. This catches
 * the accident and the obvious, which is most of them, and 0007 says the rest
 * plainly.
