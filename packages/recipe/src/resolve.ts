/**
 * Resolving a recipe: read it from `origin/<base>`, validate it, hash it.
 *
 * The governance rule, in one place. Borrowed wholesale from GitHub Actions:
 * **the workflow that judges a change is read from the base branch, not from the
 * branch being judged.** So an agent that edits `.lingtai/config.yaml`
 * changes nothing about the run in flight — the recipe was already snapshotted
 * and its hash recorded in `RunStarted` — the edit shows up in the diff where
 * the `tamper` gate catches it, and it takes effect from the next work item,
 * after a human approves and merges it.
 *
 * The reading is done by whatever `ReadAtRef` is given, and the only
 * implementation that matters reads through the GitHub API, where "at this ref"
 * is a server-side fact rather than a claim about a local checkout.
 * See doc/decisions/0005-config-in-target-repo.md.
