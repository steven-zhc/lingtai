/**
 * Verifying a GitHub delivery, and deciding whether it means anything.
 *
 * Pure: it takes a body, some headers and a secret, and returns a verdict. The
 * appending is the caller's job, which is what lets this be tested without a
 * database and without an HTTP server.
 *
 * ## The signature check is the whole security boundary
 *
 * A webhook endpoint is the one part of this system reachable from the public
 * internet, and anybody can POST to it. Without the signature it is a way to
 * make somebody else's machine run agents. So the comparison is
 * constant-time — `timingSafeEqual`, on buffers of equal length, which is why
 * the length is checked first rather than left to throw — and a delivery that
 * fails is dropped and counted rather than logged with its body.
 *
 * ## Idempotence
 *
 * GitHub retries a delivery several times on any non-2xx, and will happily
 * send the same `X-GitHub-Delivery` again. Since the only effect of a delivery
 * here is "ask GitHub what the queue is", a duplicate is close to harmless —
 * but it still wakes the conductor, and waking it four times for one issue is
 * how a rate limit gets hit. The delivery id is carried on the event so the
 * caller can drop one it has already seen.
