/**
 * GitHub App authentication.
 *
 * An App, not a personal access token. A fine-grained PAT can do everything
 * Lingtai needs and can also be wrong in a way nothing reports: on
 * 2026-08-30 one covered the admin repository's *submodule* but not the
 * repository itself, and every CI run failed with a 403 that said nothing about
 * scope. Which repositories an App can reach is explicit in its installation,
 * so the same mistake is visible at install time rather than a day later.
 * See doc/decisions/0006-github-app.md.
 *
 * Two credentials, two lifetimes:
 *
 *   app JWT             signed locally with the private key, ~9 minutes,
 *                       identifies the *App* and can only read installations
 *   installation token  fetched with that JWT, ~1 hour, identifies the App
 *                       *on one repository* and is what every real call uses
 *
 * Callers never see either. `tokenFor()` hands back a valid installation token
 * and refreshes it before it expires, so "token refresh is transparent" is a
 * property of the type rather than something every call site remembers.
 *
 * No dependency for the JWT: `node:crypto` signs RS256, which is the whole of
 * what GitHub asks for.
