/**
 * A repository-scoped GitHub client.

 * Everything here is a read or a write GitHub is the *display surface* for —

 * out; nothing reads a label back to decide anything. That inversion is the one
 * the whole design rests on (doc/decisions/0001-event-sourcing.md), so the
 * absence of a "read the agent:* labels" method here is deliberate.
 *
 * The one exception is discovery, which reads issues *once* to learn that a work
 * item exists. After that the log is the authority.
