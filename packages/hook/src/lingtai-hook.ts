/**
 * `lingtai-hook` — the only hot path in the system.
 *
 * `PostToolUse` fires after every tool call an agent makes: thousands across a
 * run. So this is a **thin client** and nothing else. It reads JSON on stdin,
 * sends one line to a unix socket, reads one line back, and exits. No
 * dependencies, no configuration parsing, no decisions. Deciding and persisting
 * live in the long-running conductor, where they cost nothing per call
 * (doc/decisions/0002-typescript.md).
 *
 * `PreToolUse` was the hot one and is not wired at all any more: Lingtai
 * refuses no tool call, so it had no job left ([ADR 0016 §6](../../../doc/decisions/0016-the-settled-model.md)).
 *
 * **It fails closed.** Socket unreachable, timeout, unparseable payload,
 * malformed reply — every one of them exits 2, which both runtimes read as
 * "refuse this tool call". A hook that fails open is worse than no hook,
 * because it is trusted. The conductor proves this path with a smoke test at
 * startup and refuses to start if the binary does not deny when the socket is
 * gone.
 *
 * Exit codes are the contract:
 *   0  allow
 *   2  deny — the reason goes to stderr, which the runtime shows the agent
