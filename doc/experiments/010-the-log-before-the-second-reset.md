# 010 — The whole log, archived before the second reset

**2026-09-03.** [ADR 0019](../decisions-archive/0019-a-second-reset.md) empties the log
a second time. This is everything that was in it — 56 events, `seq` 10 to 65,
the complete record of the settled model's first three runs against
`nextloom-ai-admin`.

Two of them landed. #157 went queue to merged at `c488abe` in 8 turns and $0.63,
and #158 at `bc7f71f` in 6 turns and $0.55; both were closed on GitHub by an
action at the `end` point rather than by a person
([experiment 009](009-the-end-gate-closes-its-own-issue.md)). The third spent 30
turns and $1.82 to produce no commits at all and was refused before the gates,
with the work item released — which is the more useful of the three, because it
is the failure being *visible* instead of merged.

Two `ConductorPaused` events are in here too, and they are the honest record of
a real operational problem: after the first reset the log no longer knew that
#120, #155 and #156 had landed, so the queue offered them again as runnable.
The pause reason says so in the operator's own words.

Kept because it is the only copy. This file, [007](007-the-log-before-the-reset.md)
and [009](009-the-end-gate-closes-its-own-issue.md) are together the whole of
what this system has done in production, and after this the log starts at zero
for the third time and — the point of 0019 — the last.
