("st-append", 0, "feature", "Store: append and read, with optimistic concurrency", """
**Phase 0** · The write side of the event log.

## What
`append(streamId, expectedVersion, events)` and `read(streamId, fromVersion?)` over
Prisma 8. A unique violation on `(stream_id, version)` means another writer won —
surface it as a typed `ConcurrencyError`, not a Prisma error, so callers re-read and
retry without knowing what an ORM is.

That constraint is the entire concurrency control. There is no lock table and nothing
to clean up after a `kill -9`.

## Done when
- [ ] `append` is atomic across a batch: all events in one call land or none do
- [ ] A concurrent append at the same expected version raises `ConcurrencyError`
- [ ] Payloads are validated through `parsePayload` on the way in and out
- [ ] `readAll(fromSeq, limit)` exists for projection catch-up
- [ ] Tests cover the race with two real connections, not mocks
"""),

("st-listen", 0, "feature", "Store: subscribe over LISTEN/NOTIFY, with reconnect", """
**Phase 0** · What makes the system event-driven rather than timed.

## What
`subscribe(onSeq)` on a dedicated `pg` connection listening to the `lingtai`
channel. Prisma has no LISTEN/NOTIFY, so this sits alongside it — see
[ADR 0004](../blob/main/doc/decisions-archive/0004-prisma.md).

The payload is the seq only, so a listener reads the row it is told about.

## Done when
- [ ] A dropped connection reconnects with backoff and resumes from the last seq
- [ ] Nothing is missed across a reconnect: catch-up by `readAll` before going live
- [ ] The trigger from `packages/store/sql/notify.sql` is applied and verified
- [ ] A test kills the connection mid-stream and asserts no gap and no duplicate

## Notes
This is the reason the store is Postgres and not SQLite. If it works, `interval`
never has to exist as a configuration value.

**Phase 0** · The state machine, as a pure function.

## What
`reduce(events) -> state` for each of the three aggregates. Zero I/O — this is the
part of the old loop that was untestable (`integrate()`'s six branches) becoming a
function you can call with a list.

## Done when
- [ ] Every transition in [design.md §4](../blob/main/doc/design.md) is covered
- [ ] Contradictory state is unrepresentable — the old `agent:blocked` + `agent:review`
      pair cannot be constructed
- [ ] Unknown event types are ignored rather than throwing, so an old projection
      survives a new event
- [ ] `schemaVer` upcasting has a hook, exercised by at least one test fixture
"""),

("st-proj", 0, "feature", "Store: projection runner with checkpoints and rebuild", """
**Phase 0** · How derived tables stay derived.

## What
A runner that advances a named projection through the log by `seq`, recording
progress in `checkpoints`. Plus `rebuild(name)`: truncate, reset the checkpoint,
replay.

## Done when
- [ ] Catch-up and live modes, with the handoff losing nothing
- [ ] A handler that throws stops that projection and leaves its checkpoint intact
- [ ] `rebuild` produces a byte-identical table to the incremental path
- [ ] Lag per projection is queryable — `lingtai doctor` reports it

## Notes
This property is why no projection is declared in the Prisma contract yet: changing
one costs a truncate, not a migration.

**Phase 0** · The old `preflight()`, generalised.

## What
The `lingtai` entry point, and `doctor` as its first real command. The old loop refused
to start when its guard hook failed a smoke test; that instinct was right and should
apply to every check.

## Done when
- [ ] Checks: config schema, recipe vs policy conflict, repo and base branch,
      submodules, env allowlist with the production tripwire, hook fail-closed,
      Postgres connectivity, projection lag, GitHub auth and labels
- [ ] Each check prints what it found, not just a tick
- [ ] Non-zero exit on any failure, so it can gate a restart
- [ ] A conflict names the offending clause

Its value is not the first run. It is every time afterwards you change something and
want to know what you broke.

**Phase 0** · The one task that needs a human first.

## What
Point `DATABASE_URL` at Lingtai's own database — not one belonging to a managed
project — and bring the schema up.

```
pnpm db:init
pnpm db:verify
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f packages/store/sql/notify.sql
```

## Done when
- [ ] `events`, `checkpoints` and `outbox` exist, with `data` and `payload` as `jsonb`
- [ ] The `lingtai` NOTIFY trigger fires on insert
- [ ] The append-only rules reject an `UPDATE` and a `DELETE` against `events`
- [ ] `.env.local` is filled in and still untracked

## Notes
The last step is not Prisma's job and is not optional — Prisma models tables, not
triggers or rules.

("gh-app", 1, "feature", "GitHub: the App client and `lingtai add`", """
**Phase 1** · Onboarding is a repo slug plus permissions, and nothing else.

## What
A GitHub App client (installation tokens, not a PAT — see
[ADR 0006](../blob/main/doc/decisions-archive/0006-github-app.md)) and `lingtai add <owner>/<repo>`,
which reads `.lingtai/config.yaml` from the base branch, applies a default policy,
and registers the project.

## Done when
- [ ] Issues, contents, pull requests and metadata permissions verified at add time
- [ ] A repository the App is not installed on fails with that as the message
- [ ] `ProjectPolicySet` and `ProjectConfigured` land as events
- [ ] Token refresh is transparent to callers

## Notes
A fine-grained PAT covering the submodule but not the main repo cost a day of 403s on
admin CI. The App makes that visible at install time.

**Phase 1** · The governance rule, in code.

## What
Read `.lingtai/config.yaml` from `origin/<base>` — **never from the agent's
branch** — merge the preset, validate against the schema, check it does not violate
policy, and hash the result into `RunStarted`.

## Done when
- [ ] The recipe used by a run is provably the base-branch version
- [ ] An agent editing the file changes nothing about the run in flight
- [ ] A recipe that removes a mandatory gate or lowers the tier is rejected, naming
      the clause
- [ ] The resolved hash is recorded and reproducible

("discover", 1, "feature", "Conductor: discover work items and build the queue", """
**Phase 1** · GitHub becomes an input source, not a database.

## What
Poll issues into `WorkItemDiscovered`, and a `queue` projection that answers what is
runnable and in what order — replacing `pick_ticket`'s search. Priority is the
recipe's `kinds` order, oldest first.

## Done when
- [ ] Labels are read once at discovery and never consulted again for state
- [ ] Your own `blocked` label and the `agent:*` namespace are both excluded
- [ ] Re-discovering an existing item is a no-op, not a duplicate event
- [ ] `lingtai status` prints the queue

## Notes
Phase 1 runs against issue numbers you nominate, not the queue — `agent-loop.sh` is
still working the same repository and the two must not both claim a ticket.

("claim-wt", 1, "feature", "Conductor: claim with a lease, and provision the worktree", """
**Phase 1** · Replaces the lock directory and everything it leaked.

## What
`WorkItemClaimed` appended at an expected version — the loser of a race gets a
constraint violation and backs off. Then a worktree cut from `origin/<base>`, with
submodules initialised and the filtered env planted at the recipe's `plantAt`.

## Done when
- [ ] Two claimants racing produce exactly one winner
- [ ] A lease that expires needs no cleanup — absence of a heartbeat is the expiry
- [ ] Submodules are initialised; skipping this makes every test importing one fail
      and reads as the agent breaking them
- [ ] The env file holds only allowlisted names, and a production-looking value
      aborts the run

("hook-bin", 1, "feature", "Hook: the `lingtai-hook` binary and the conductor socket", """
**Phase 1** · One channel, both directions.

## What
A Bun-compiled single file with no dependencies: read stdin, connect to a unix
socket, return the verdict, exit. Policy and persistence live in the conductor.

## Done when
- [ ] Under 20ms at the 95th percentile, measured, not assumed
- [ ] **Fails closed**: unreachable socket, timeout or unparseable payload all exit 2
- [ ] A startup smoke test proves the fail-closed path, and the conductor refuses to
      start if it does not
- [ ] Hook configuration is rendered by the conductor **outside the worktree**, so an
      agent cannot edit its own wiring
- [ ] Verdict is synchronous; persistence of an allowed call is not, so the event
      store's availability never gates a tool call

**Phase 1** · Make 132 invisible events visible.

## What
Evaluate the project's deny list and production host patterns against each tool call,
and append `GuardTripped` on a denial with the command redacted.

## Done when
- [ ] Blocks: production hosts, DDL, `db push`, `pr merge`, pushing to base,
      force-push, `rm -rf`, reading `.env`
- [ ] Allows: dev-database reads and writes, tests, pushing `agent/*`, `pr create`,
      reading `.env.local`, writing migration files
- [ ] A test matrix covers both lists and runs in CI
- [ ] Trips are counted per run and visible on the board card

## Notes
This is policy enforcement and observation, **not a security boundary** — a model can
write a script to step around a pattern. The real boundaries are the filtered env, the
worktree, and a sandbox. [ADR 0007](../blob/main/doc/decisions-archive/0007-dual-runtime.md).

      five-event intersection both runtimes share — are mapped
- [ ] `SessionEnd`, `PreCompact` and `Notification` are mapped as bonus signal, with

## What
Run a command from the recipe, with a timeout; the exit code is the verdict. Emit
`GateRequested` / `Started` / `Passed` / `Failed`, all carrying `onSha`.

## Done when
- [ ] `onSha` is on every verdict — a force-push must invalidate, not inherit
- [ ] A failure captures enough log tail to be actionable from the board

("integrate", 1, "feature", "Conductor: the integrator", """
**Phase 1** · Where the old loop failed silently six different ways.

## What
Merge base in, verify, then merge out — in a worktree the integrator owns, under
`pg_advisory_lock('merge:' || project || ':' || base)`. **Never in your checkout.**

## Done when
- [ ] Every refusal is an `IntegrationRefused` with a typed reason: `conflict`,
      `dirty-base`, `unpushed-base`, `pending-migration`, `gate-failed`,
      `no-commits`, `lane-busy`
- [ ] **No code path returns without an event.** This is the whole point of the ticket
- [ ] Your working checkout is never read from or written to
- [ ] Two integrations against one base serialise

The `board` projection, and cards rendered from it. `loadBoard` stops being a
placeholder.

## Done when
- [ ] Five columns fed from the projection, not from fixtures
- [ ] A running card shows turn, cost, **guard trips**, and containment tier

## What
A second agent given only the issue, the diff and the touched files — never the
implementer's plan or transcript. Structured findings are the verdict.

## Done when
- [ ] Fresh context, verifiable: the reviewer's prompt contains no implementer output
- [ ] Findings carry file, line, claim, **and a concrete failure scenario**. No
      failure scenario, no finding
- [ ] The severity rubric is fixed in the prompt — left to judgement, the reviewer

## What
Glob the diff's file list; on a match, request approval. Two instances ship together:
the migration hold, and `tamper`.

## Done when
- [ ] `tamper` watches `.lingtai/**`, `package.json#scripts`, test configuration
      and `.github/workflows/**`
- [ ] The migration hold catches an unapplied migration and holds the branch unmerged
- [ ] A held branch says which file and what to do about it
- [ ] Globs are compiled at `lingtai doctor` time, so a broken pattern fails early

**Phase 5 epic.** Not split into tickets yet, for the same reason as Phase 4.

The material already exists: 73 runs, 132 guard trips, 31 merged diffs, and a labelled
defect set. [Experiment 001](../blob/main/doc/experiments/001-cold-review-issue-58.md)
used one of them by hand — this phase makes that a command.

## Scope
- [ ] `lingtai replay` — run a gate pipeline against historical diffs
- [ ] False-positive rate for the review gate across all 31 merged diffs. **n=1 says
      nothing about the distribution**
- [ ] `regressions` projection, injected into the reviewer's prompt: when a diff
      touches a file with a history of check-then-write races, say so
- [ ] `run_receipts` on the board — cost and duration percentiles, cost per landed item
- [ ] Cluster the 132 guard trips into real blocks and false alarms, and tune
- [ ] Prompt comparison keyed on `promptVersion`
- [ ] Adversarial verification for the review gate — **only once false positives
      actually appear**
