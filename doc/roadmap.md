# Roadmap

Seven phases. Each has an **exit criterion** that is a fact, not a feeling — if it
cannot be demonstrated, the phase is not done.

Two sequencing constraints drive the whole shape:

1. **`agent-loop.sh` keeps working tickets until Phase 2 cuts over.** Phase 1
   proves the machinery on one ticket under supervision; it does not replace
   anything. The old loop is retired only when Lingtai has done its job
   unattended for a week.
2. **Lingtai manages itself from Phase 4, not before.** Self-hosting is a
   test of the system, so it needs a system that has already passed a real one.

| | Phase | Exit criterion |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | System scaffold | An event round-trips through Postgres and a projection rebuilds from the log · **done** |
| 1 | Minimum runnable unit | One real admin ticket goes discovery → merge with `lingtai run --once`, supervised · **done 2026-09-01** |
| 2 | Take over admin | Lingtai works admin unattended for a week; `agent-loop.sh` is retired |
| 3 | The settled model | Five gate points, no policy, no guard; the loop still closes unattended · **done 2026-09-02** |
| 4 | Self-hosting | Lingtai lands a change to its own repository, through its own gates |
| 5 | Multi-project | A second repository runs with no code change, only a descriptor |
| 6 | Feedback loop | A gate change is evaluated by replay against history before it ships |

---

## Phase 0 — System scaffold

**Goal.** The parts that need no agent, no GitHub and no judgement: the log, the
projections, and a command that tells you what is broken.

Already done and committed: repository, `@lingtai/domain` event catalogue,
`@lingtai/recipe` recipe schema, the Postgres contract under Prisma 8 with
its migration applied, the Next.js board shell, the decision records, and the
log's write side — `append` / `read` / `readAll` with optimistic concurrency
(#1) — and the subscriber, which reconnects and resumes without gap or duplicate
(#2, [experiment 002](experiments/002-subscriber-survives-a-kill.md)).

Since then: the three aggregate reducers, pure and zero-I/O (#3) — the old
loop's least testable code, the six branches of `integrate()`, is now a function
you can call with a list.

Then the projection runner (#4): checkpoints advanced in the same transaction as
the projection's own writes, `rebuild` proven to produce the same table as the
incremental path, and `guard_trips` as the first real projection — the 132
invisible guard blocks, finally countable.

And `lingtai doctor` (#5), which is the old `preflight()` generalised: it reads and
never writes, it proves the direct connection is genuinely session mode rather
than merely reachable ([experiment 003](experiments/003-doctor-catches-a-pooler.md)),
and it prints the six checks it cannot run yet as skips naming the issue that
will fill them in.

**Phase 0 is done.** `lingtai doctor` is green — 10 ok, 6 deferred, 0 failed.

**Exit criterion.** `lingtai doctor` is green, an event round-trips, and a projection
can be dropped and rebuilt from the log with an identical result.

## Phase 1 — Minimum runnable unit

**Goal.** One ticket, end to end, with a person watching. `lingtai run --once` picks
a real admin issue, provisions a worktree, runs Claude Code under the guard hook,
runs the build gate, and merges — or refuses with a typed reason.

This is the proof of value. It is deliberately narrow: one project, one runtime,
one gate, one work item at a time, and no approval flow. Every gate kind, the
board's write actions, and unattended operation are all Phase 2.

**`agent-loop.sh` keeps running throughout.** Nothing here competes with it, and
the two must not both hold `agent:wip` on the same issue — Phase 1 runs against
`agent:hold`-free tickets you nominate by number, not against the queue.

**Exit criterion.** A real admin issue is merged into `develop` by Lingtai,
and the board shows it in Landed with its receipt.

**Status: met, 2026-09-01.** `nextloom-ai-admin` [#155][a155] was taken from a
GitHub issue to `be25a20` on `develop` by Lingtai — recipe from `origin`,
claim, worktree from the mirror, `pnpm install`, Claude Code, the build gate
(`pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm test`, green in 22.3s), a hold at the
merge gate, an approval clicked on the board, and the merge lane under its
advisory lock. 13 turns, $0.86. [#120][a120] landed the same way at 46 turns and
$4.22.

It took four attempts and each one bought a defect that no test had:

| Attempt | Died at | Cause |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | agent, 30 turns, $1.11 | The prompt said "read the issue" and gave a number. There was no `gh` to read it with. |
| 2 | agent, 45 turns, $3.35 | No `--permission-mode`, so `-p` refused every write and could not prompt. The guard denied nothing; nothing reached the guard. |
| 3 | landed | — |
| 4 | landed | — |

The gap between attempts 2 and 3 is the whole lesson of this phase. Attempt 2's
log recorded fifteen `RunTouchedFile` events with `op: "write"` against a
worktree the agent had not modified — `PostToolUse` was recording every `Read`.
The system was reporting work that had not happened, which is worse than
reporting nothing, and it is the failure mode the log exists to prevent.

**Cost discipline is the other lesson.** #120 is a feature and cost $4.22 per
attempt to learn one thing about the pipeline. #155 was a text-only change,
scoped in advance to nine files with the six that could not work named as out of
scope, and cost $0.86. The pipeline is what was under test; the agent was not.
Test it with the cheapest ticket that exercises the same eight steps.

## Phase 2 — Take over admin

**Goal.** Everything that turns one supervised run into an unattended system.

This is where the board stops being a status page. The old loop's review queue
reached 45 items growing at 14 a day against zero processed, because working it
meant leaving the tool. If Phase 2 ships and that number does not move, the
bottleneck was never tooling — which is worth knowing.

**Re-planned 2026-09-01, after Phase 1 landed.** Four gate kinds and the board's
approve / reject / waive were built and are done. What replaced them in this
phase is a change of shape, recorded in [0012](decisions/0012-one-task-view.md)
and [0013](decisions/0013-daemon-hosts-the-work.md): one `TaskView` instead of
three projections, the queue read from GitHub instead of mirrored into the log,
and a daemon that holds the conductor and the projection follower while the UI
controls it and watches it.

The prompt for that change was a small incident with a large lesson. Two work
items merged into `develop` for real while their cards sat in "waiting on you",
because nothing was advancing the projections and nothing said so. The operator
saw a button that did nothing. Every item in this phase is now judged against
whether it would have made that visible.

| Stage | What it delivers | Done when |
|---|---|---|
| **2a** | The minimum runnable daemon: one lock, the projection follower, `TaskView`, the UI reading it · **done** | An issue goes queue → landed and the card moves on its own, with nobody running a command — *met 2026-09-02, admin #156* |
| **2b** | Control and liveness: pause / resume / run-now through the log, `daemon_status` heartbeat · **done** | The board can stop the daemon taking work, and always says whether it is up |
| **2c** | Robustness: attempt backoff, `Reconciled` at startup, webhooks · **done** | A failed ticket does not re-run in a loop, and a crash leaves nothing stuck |
| **2d** | The outbox, labels and comments, notifications · **done** | Nothing that leaves the machine can vanish without a record |

Stage 2a is the bar for "the model is running". Nothing that is an optimisation
belongs before it.

**Status, 2026-09-02.** 2a, 2b, 2c and 2d are built, and **2a is verified**:
admin #156 went queue → landed at `06e8bbe` (15 turns, $0.83) from one
`lingtai now`, with no command issued after it, and the completion event drove the
next pass by itself. See `doc/experiments/006-the-loop-closes-unattended.md`,
including the two defects the run found that no unit test had — `lingtai now` not
running the issue it named, and the outbox deleting every label it did not put
there.

Two items filed under 2d turned out to need nothing. **Queue caching** was how
`syncQueued` worked — and it is gone: [0022](decisions/0022-the-seams.md)
deleted the cache, so the board does ask GitHub on render, and #56 and #57 died
with it. If a rate limit ever bites, a cache comes back with a reason and with
somebody watching it. **Retention** is already a parameter on `readTasks`,
because 0012 put it in the query rather than the projection. Structured logging was not done and is not tracked; nothing has
needed it yet.

What was cut from #25 is worth naming: labels are written when a task changes
state, but not *reconciled*. Deleting every `lingtai:*` label by hand and
restarting would not restore them, which the issue asked for. That needs a
periodic sweep comparing GitHub against `task_view`. What has *not*
happened is one uninterrupted queue-to-landed run with nobody typing a command —
every piece of it is verified separately and the whole has not been watched
once, which is a different claim and the phase is not done until it is made.

The cutover is also outstanding and is deliberately not a code task. 35 of
`nextloom-ai-admin`'s 37 open issues still carry `agent:*` labels, and that
exclusion is the only thing keeping the daemon off them — removing it hands a
35-item backlog to something that spends money per item, on the strength of two
successful runs. Watch it work first ([#29](https://github.com/steven-zhc/lingtai/issues/29)).

**Cutover.** `agent-loop.sh` is retired at the end, not the start. Both systems
run in parallel first, with Lingtai on a subset of labels, so a failure has
somewhere to fall back to.

**Exit criterion.** Lingtai takes **two consecutive issues** from the queue
through to merged, with no manual intervention beyond approving on the board.

*Tightened from "seven consecutive days" on 2026-09-01.* Seven days is a
measurement of reliability, and reliability is not what Phase 2 builds — it
builds the mechanisms. A week of uptime can be bought by a quiet week, and it
cannot be run at all until the mechanisms exist, so it was a criterion that
could neither fail early nor pass on merit.

Two consecutive issues is a smaller claim and a sharper one. **Consecutive is
the load-bearing word**: it means the conductor picked the second one up by
itself. One issue proves the pipeline; two in a row prove there is nothing in
it that only works once — a lock not released, a worktree not removed, a
checkpoint not advanced. Those are the failures that a single supervised run
cannot show and a week of uptime would only show slowly.

Uptime is still worth measuring. It belongs to the cutover, next to retiring
`agent-loop.sh`, not to the phase that writes the code.

## Phase 3 — The settled model

[ADR 0016](decisions/0016-the-settled-model.md) is the specification. This is
mostly **deletion**: the policy concept goes, the eight tool rules leave the
core for a preset, and four gate *kinds* become five gate *points* whose actions
come from presets or plugins. The load-bearing machinery — event store,
subscribe, projections, worktree, integrate, hook socket, GitHub client — is not
touched.

The log is reset once at the start (0016 §9), so there are no upcasters and no
data backfill for any of it. That licence is not available again.

| Step | What changes | Done when |
|---|---|---|
| **3a** ✓ | **Delete the guard** — `guard.ts`, the eight rules, `GuardTripped`, `guard_trips`, `smokeTestFailClosed`, `--no-guard`, the `PreToolUse` wiring. Add the `doctor` check that reports live settings sources | Lingtai restricts no tool call, seven hooks still work, and `lingtai doctor` says which settings sources are in scope for a run |
| **3b** ✓ | Delete `policy.ts`, `policyConflicts`, `ProjectPolicySet`, `requiredGates`, `approvers`, `concurrent`; `tier` moves to `runtime.tier` | `lingtai status` no longer has a policy line, and nothing refuses a recipe for being too permissive |
| **3c** ✓ | Five gate points; `GatesResolved`; the four kinds become actions · **done** `d50a7d9` | A run appends one `GatesResolved` naming all five points, with `[]` where nothing is configured |
| **3c′** ✓ | Fold `prepare` into the `prepared` point — split out of 3c, because it deletes three events and reroutes the board | `PreparationStarted/Passed/Failed` are gone and the install step is declared at `gates.prepared` |
| **3d** ✓ | The `end` gate; closing the issue as an action; `labelsFor` out of the outbox | A landed issue is closed, and what closed it is named in the recipe |
| **3e** ✓ | Board: four states, five points, `skipped` rendered | An unconfigured gate is **visible as skipped**, never omitted — 0016 §4 |
| **3f** ✓ | Re-run one admin ticket end to end | The loop still closes unattended, on the new model |

**3e is the one that matters.** If a skipped gate is omitted rather than shown,
the whole design degrades into the plugin free-for-all
[0014](decisions/0014-one-loop-one-log.md) rejected, and it degrades silently.

## Phase 4 — Self-hosting

**Goal.** Lingtai manages its own repository.

This is not a victory lap, it is the hardest correctness problem in the project:
**an agent editing the conductor that is running it.** Three rules follow.

- **Lingtai's own recipe is the strictest one.** No point left empty, a `watch`
  covering its own source, and `merge` always held for a person. It gets no
  benefit of the doubt it would extend to a business repository.
- **The conductor never restarts itself.** A merge to `main` lands; the running
  daemon keeps executing the old code until a person runs `lingtai restart`. That is
  the lingtai principle applied to the lingtai: energy released one tooth
  at a time, deliberately.
- **`lingtai doctor` runs against the new code before the restart, not after.** A
  merge that breaks the scheduler must not be discovered by the scheduler failing
  to start.

**Exit criterion.** A change to Lingtai's own code is implemented by an agent,
passes its own gates, is approved on the board, merges, and is running after a
deliberate restart.

## Phase 5 — Multi-project

**Goal.** The claim that a second repository costs a descriptor and nothing else,
tested by doing it. Plus the Codex adapter, real concurrency, and the containment
tier that Phase 0–3 deferred.

Concurrency is last on purpose. The old loop landed seven tickets in a night
while the review backlog grew by fourteen; throughput was never the constraint.
Raising it before the board demonstrably draws the queue down would make the
problem worse, faster.

**Exit criterion.** `nextloom-ai-press` runs with a descriptor under twenty lines
and no change to any package.

## Phase 6 — Feedback loop

**Goal.** Make the system able to evaluate changes to itself against history.

The material already exists: 73 runs, 132 guard trips, 31 merged diffs, and a
labelled defect set. [Experiment 001](experiments/001-cold-review-issue-58.md)
used one of them by hand. This phase makes that a command.

**Exit criterion.** A change to the gate pipeline is replayed against historical
runs, and the comparison is what decides whether it ships.

---

## Backlog

Thirty-five issues, created in dependency order so each one references the
real number of what it needs. Phases 5 and 6 are single epics on purpose —
their shape depends on what Phases 1–4 teach, and pre-writing tickets that
will be rewritten is exactly the noise this system exists to remove.

**Phase 3 has no tickets.** The settled model was worked as 3a–3f against
[0016](decisions/0016-the-settled-model.md) directly, in this repository, without
issues — which is why the numbering below skips from Phase 2 to Phase 4.

## Not on this roadmap

Deliberately, and for the reasons in [design.md §8](design.md#8-deliberately-not-building):
no message broker, no separate read database, no snapshots, no general workflow
engine, no configuration UI, no authentication, no work-item DAG. Each of those
becomes worth revisiting only when a specific failure demands it, and none has
yet.
