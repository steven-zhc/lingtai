 * The board is not a status page. It is where the backlog gets worked, and the
 * old loop's review queue reached 45 items growing at 14 a day against zero
 * processed because working one meant leaving the tool.
 *
 * **The card carries what you scan; everything else is one click away.** It
 * used to carry the gate evidence, the findings and the diff too, and it grew
 * heavy for a structural reason: the projection made all of it available, and
 * what is available gets rendered. Since 0012 the list reads one table and the
 * detail is folded from the event stream on demand, which makes a card's
 * contents a decision instead of a consequence.
 *
 * The controls stay on the card. Deciding is the thing this exists for, and
 * making somebody open a page to approve would put back the cost that the 45
 * items measured.
