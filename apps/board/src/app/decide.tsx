/**
 * The controls on a card that is waiting on you.
 *
 * The optimistic state is the point and also the trap. Showing the result
 * immediately is what makes a queue of 45 feel workable; showing a result that
 * did not happen is worse than showing nothing, because the operator moves on
 * believing the item is handled. So every action **reverts on refusal and says
 * why** — the server's own sentence, not a generic "something went wrong".
 *
 * The commonest refusal is the interesting one: the branch moved between the
 * card rendering and the click, so the diff being approved is not the diff that
 * was read. That has to be visible, not swallowed.

 * used to render Approve, and Approve could not work: `approve()` accepts only
 * `awaiting-approval` and the run is back to `gating`. Three items sat like
 * that, one of them for four days (#84).
 *
 * So the card offers what it really has. Putting it back in the queue means the
 * next attempt is cut from a base that has since moved, which for the
 * commonest case — a conflict nobody chose to repair — is the fix. The reason
 * is required for the same reason a waiver's is: a person overruling a block
 * without saying why is how a system stops being able to explain itself.
