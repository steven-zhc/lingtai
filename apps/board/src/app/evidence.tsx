/**
 * Everything you need to decide, on the card.
 *
 * The rule this is built against: **if you have to open GitHub to decide,
 * nothing changed.** The old review queue did not stall because the decisions
 * were hard; it stalled because making one meant leaving the tool, and the cost
 * of leaving is what 45-items-growing-at-14-a-day measures.
 *
 * So a build failure shows its log tail, a review failure shows its findings
 * *with the failure scenarios* — the scenario is the finding, the claim alone
 * is an opinion — and a `watch` hold shows the files it matched. All collapsed
 * by default, because a card that is three screens tall is its own kind of
 * unreadable.
 *
 * The diff is deliberately not syntax-highlighted by language. It is
 * highlighted structurally — added, removed, hunk header, file header — which
 * is what a reviewer reads a diff *for*. Language highlighting means shipping a
 * grammar bundle into a local operator console, and the value of that against
 * its weight has not been argued for. Said plainly rather than quietly skipped.
