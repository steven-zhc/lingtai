/**
 * The one endpoint reachable from outside.
 *
 * A verified `issues` delivery appends `QueueChanged`, and the daemon — which
 * already wakes on appends — asks GitHub what the queue is now. One mechanism
 * rather than two: the webhook does not need a socket to the daemon, and the
 * daemon does not need to know a webhook exists.
 *
 * **It lives on the board, and that does not contradict [0013].** The board is
 * a reader and a controller: it renders `task_view` and it appends decisions.
 * This appends a fact. What it never does is hold a run, which is the actual
 * dividing line.
 *
 * ## It is an optimisation, not a dependency
 *
 * This machine has no public address, so a delivery only arrives through a
 * tunnel somebody has set up. The daemon sweeps GitHub on a long interval
 * regardless, so a webhook that never arrives costs latency and nothing else —
 * which is the property that makes it safe to leave unconfigured.
