/**
 * `lingtai approve <project> --issue <n>` — merge what a held run actually produced.
 *
 * The counterpart to `lingtai run --once --no-merge`. Without it that flag is half a
 * feature: the only other way to finish a held run is to run it again without
 * the flag, which starts a new run with a new worktree and a new diff — so the
 * thing that merges is not the thing anyone looked at.
