/**
 * The projections this application knows how to advance, and how to advance
 * them without a daemon.
 *
 * The follower lives in the daemon, which is right: it is long-lived work, and
 * [0013](../../../doc/decisions/0013-daemon-hosts-the-work.md) puts long-lived
 * work in one process behind one lock. But `lingtai run` appends too, and a
 * command that appends and returns used to leave `task_view` — the only thing
 * the board reads — exactly where it was. Nine runs went through the queue by
 * hand and the board showed nothing moving; `lingtai projection lag` said *no
 * projection has a checkpoint yet*. The fix at the time was to remember to
 * start a second process. Nothing told you that.
 *
 * So a command that appends catches the projections up on its way out. It is
 * not a second follower: it starts each runner, waits for it to reach the head,
 * and closes it. The board is therefore correct the moment the command returns,
 * and stale only *during* — which is what the daemon is for.
 *
 * Running this while a daemon holds the log is harmless and needs no lock. A
 * projection's `apply` is idempotent and its checkpoint advances inside the
 * same transaction as its writes, so two followers on the same log converge on
 * the same rows; the second one simply finds nothing left to do.
