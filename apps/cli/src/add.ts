/**
 * `lingtai add <owner>/<repo>` — the whole of onboarding.
 *
 * Give it a repository slug and permissions; it does the rest. What it does
 * *not* do is take a configuration file: the recipe belongs to the managed
 * repository and is read from its base branch. That split is
 * doc/decisions/0005-config-in-target-repo.md, and it is why this command needs
 * so few arguments.
 *
 * The order matters. Permissions are checked *before* anything is written, so a
 * half-onboarded project is not a state that exists. The failure this guards
 * against is specific: a fine-grained PAT that covered the admin repository's
 * submodule but not the repository itself produced a day of 403s on CI, and
 * nothing anywhere said "wrong scope".
