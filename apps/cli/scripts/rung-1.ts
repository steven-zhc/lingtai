/**
 * Rung 1 of the ladder in #39: does the plumbing reach a real repository?
 *
 * Seven seams have never touched reality, and a single full run would light all
 * seven at once — if it failed, nobody would know which, and every retry would
 * cost agent money. This lights four of them, for free:
 *
 *   1. GitHub App authentication → an installation token
 *   2. git over https with that token injected
 *   3. a cross-repository submodule fetch with the same token
 *   4. the prepare stage, against a real dependency tree
 *
 * **It starts no agent and writes nothing to GitHub.** It clones, prepares, and
 * reports. The only things it touches are Lingtai's own mirror and worktree
 * under `LINGTAI_HOME`, and it removes the worktree afterwards.
 *
 * It also uses an in-memory event store rather than the real one. A run that
 * never happened should not leave a run-shaped hole in the log, and the evidence
 * this produces is its own output, which goes into doc/experiments/.
 *
 * Lives under `apps/cli` rather than at the root because that is where the
 * workspace links to `@lingtai/*` resolve — a script at the top level is not
 * a package and cannot import them.
 *
 *   node --experimental-strip-types apps/cli/scripts/rung-1.ts <owner>/<repo>
