 * found: fifteen writes in the log, an empty diff on disk, and the disagreement
 * only visible with both in front of you.

 * Deliberately not an `lingtai` subcommand. `lingtai status` and the board answer
 * "what is happening"; this answers "what exactly was appended", which is a
 * debugging question and should look like one.
